# Hey there, I'm Sarxzer 👋  

18-year-old French dev embracing chaos, cats, and retro consoles.  
I started coding during the COVID-19 lockdown with a Scratch math book… now I’m building websites, editors, terminal apps, and occasionally blowing stuff up (metaphorically… usually). 😏  

**Languages & Tools:** Python, PHP, JavaScript, Arduino, HTML, CSS, a pinch of French flair 🇫🇷  

**Projects I’m proud of:**  
- [**My Website**](https://github.com/sarxzer/sarxzer.xyz) – Learned HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL to create my chaotic corner of the web.  
- [**CC: Blockly Editor**](https://github.com/Sarxzer/cc-blockly-editor) – A code editor powered by Blockly… chaos guaranteed.  
- [**ROM.py**](https://github.com/Sarxzer/rom.py) – Terminal-based ROM browser & downloader written in Python using curses.  

**Other passions:** Retro console collector 🎮, cat enthusiast 🐾, soldering & electronics tinkerer ⚡  

AI believer—powerful tool, but only as strong as the person using it.  
I embrace chaos in code, experiments, and life, and I’m always learning, breaking, and building.
